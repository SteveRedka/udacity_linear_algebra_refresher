Solutions to [Udacity's linear algebra refresher course](https://www.udacity.com/course/linear-algebra-refresher-course--ud953) in Ruby.

## Setup
```
bundle install
```

## How it works
The course requires listener to write the models for linear algebra entities such as vectors and planes.

Those can be tested against specs:
```
rspec
```

Actual answers for each quiz are kept separately from test code, in `lib/answers`.
